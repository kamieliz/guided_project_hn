# Guided Project - Exploring Hacker News
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook analyzing posts on Hacker News and a CSV file that consists of 20,000 Hacker News Posts and corresponding data. This is from a guided project from [Dataquest](dataquest.io)'s Python for Data Science Intermediate course. In this project, I was able to analyze posts with titles that start with Ask HN or Show HN to determine which posts get the most comments per hour and which posts get the most points per hour. I was also able to determine the best times to post for each type of submission.

My certificate of Completion for Python for Data Science Intermediate course is located [here](https://app.dataquest.io/verify_cert/B727VKZU2CYV9WAVMZA1/) on January 17, 2022
